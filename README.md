# Sentiment Analysis Models Repository

This repository contains some of my older code from when I was still a student. During that time, I used Keras to create custom models such as LSTM, GRU, TextCNN, and an Ensemble GRU, specifically designed for Sentiment Analysis tasks.

Due to the large size of the dataset, I have stored it externally. You can access the dataset here: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A11Y32jmbjaE5H9c2fuOqIvel2FOEsDL?usp=sharing).

I also created a demo video to showcase the models in action. You can watch it here: [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN8Z1D9nLFI).

Please note that since this is older code, written before I learned more about best practices, the organization and presentation might not be optimal.
